  - Hey Maz, take it easy man!
  - 'You''ve been out for quite a while, I don''t think you should be walking. '
  - Can you even remember anything?  [Tutorial]
  - Alright, if you say so, i'll meet you at the party, don't be late!
  - That's what I thought.
  - 'By the time I showed up, you were already out of it. '
  - It was like your body was here but your soul was somewhere else...
  - '...anyways, there''s a party going on and everyone else is going to be there. '
  - You seem to be walking just fine so I'll just meet you there.
  - 'Oh, one last thing, make sure you look presentable, the bouncer won''t just
    let anyone in. '
  - Rumor has it, he threw some guy off the balcony because he wasn't wearing the
    right clothes...
  - ...Alright, I got some other friends waiting for me, i'll see you at the party!
