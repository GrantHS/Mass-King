  - Call me Ego
  - I thought I lost you over there.
  - Next time you feel embarrassed, just eat me.
  - I can heal your HUMILITY in an instant!
  - I'll make you feel better.
  - I wouldn't want to lose you in a breakdown.
  - If that were to happen, you might as well be dead.
  - So don't listen to those bystanders.
  - You can be whoever you want to be.
  - Now eat me and go to that party, killer!
